You can implement missing steps with the snippets below:

Given("^User opens flipkart in firefox$", () -> {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
});

When("^User mouse hover on \"([^\"]*)\"$", (String arg1) -> {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
});

When("^Click on \"([^\"]*)\"$", (String arg1) -> {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
});

When("^Checked checkbox Add to Compare for (\\d+) and (\\d+)$", (Integer arg1, Integer arg2) -> {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
});

When("^Click on COMPARE$", () -> {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
});

Then("^User should redirect to Compare page$", () -> {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new PendingException();
});
